      Obtain the Samsung Smart View SDK:

Visit the Samsung Developer website (https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/extension-libraries/smart-view-sdk.html) and download the Smart View SDK.
Extract the SDK files to a location on your computer.
Set up your Development Environment:

Launch Android Studio and create a new project.
Import the Smart View SDK library into your project.
In Android Studio, go to File -> New -> Import Module.
Navigate to the location where you extracted the Smart View SDK files and select the SmartViewSDK folder.
Click Finish to import the library module.
Ensure that your project includes the necessary permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file. For Samsung Smart TV remote control functionality, the following permission is required:
xml
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="com.samsung.android.providers.context.permission.WRITE_USE_APP_FEATURE_SURVEY" />
Implement the Remote Control Functionality:

Create a new activity or fragment in your project that will serve as the remote control interface.
Initialize the Smart View SDK in the onCreate() method of your activity/fragment using the following code:
java
Copy code
SamsungSmartViewSDK.init(this);
Establish a connection with the Samsung Smart TV using its IP address:
java
Copy code
RemoteDevice device = new RemoteDevice();
device.setIp("192.168.1.100"); // Replace with your TV's IP address
RemoteControlManager.getInstance().connect(device);
You can now control the TV by sending commands using the RemoteControlManager. For example, to change the volume, you can use:
java
Copy code
RemoteControlManager.getInstance().setVolumeUp();
You can explore the available methods in the RemoteControlManager class to perform various actions such as channel control, media playback, input selection, etc.
Test the Application:

Build and run your application on an Android device that is connected to the same network as your Samsung Smart TV.
Ensure that your Smart TV is turned on and accessible on the network.
Use the remote control interface in your application to send commands to the TV and verify the functionality
